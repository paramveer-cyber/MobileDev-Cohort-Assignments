# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### Other setup steps

- To set up ESLint for linting, run `npx expo lint`, or follow our guide on ["Using ESLint and Prettier"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/)
- If you'd like to set up unit testing, follow our guide on ["Unit Testing with Jest"](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/)
- Learn more about the TypeScript setup in this template in our guide on ["Using TypeScript"](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)

## Push notifications

Push notifications need a dev build (Expo Go doesn't support them). Build one with `bunx eas-cli build --profile development --platform android`, install it on a physical device, then run `npx expo start --dev-client`.

Backend lives in `server/`:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server listens on `PORT` (default `4000`). Set `src/lib/notifications/backend.ts`'s `PUSH_BACKEND_URL` to your machine's LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:4000`) when testing on a physical device — `localhost` only resolves on the same host as the server.

Flow: app registers its Expo push token with `POST /register` once notification permission is granted → Settings tab shows registration status and a "Send test push" button that hits `POST /send-test` with your own token → `POST /send` broadcasts to every registered device, for streak nudges or announcements sent from a script, cURL, or expo.dev/notifications.

**Why the Android channel is created before requesting permission:** on Android, a notification's importance (whether it can appear as a heads-up alert, make sound, etc.) is fixed by whichever channel it's posted to, and channels are immutable once created with a given importance. If the channel doesn't exist yet when the OS shows the permission prompt or when the first notification fires, Android silently falls back to a default low-importance channel, and reminders end up muted with no heads-up banner even though permission was granted. Creating the `habit-reminders` channel at app startup (see `src/app/_layout.tsx`) guarantees every scheduled reminder lands in a high-importance channel from the first notification onward.

**Foreground vs background push:** with the foreground handler in `src/lib/notifications/setup.ts` (`shouldShowBanner: true`), a push arriving while the app is open still surfaces as a banner instead of being silently swallowed — without that handler, foreground pushes are delivered to the app but not shown to the user. When the app is backgrounded or killed, the OS shows the system notification directly; tapping it cold-starts or resumes the app and is picked up by `handleColdStartNotificationResponseAsync` or the live `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener`, both of which route through the same `handleNotificationResponse` deep-link handler used for local reminders.
